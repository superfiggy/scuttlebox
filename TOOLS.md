# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define *how* tools work. This file is for *your* specifics — the stuff unique to this setup.

## What Goes Here

Things like:
- Camera names and locations
- SSH hosts and aliases
- Preferred voices for TTS
- Speaker/room names
- Device nicknames
- API quirks you've discovered

## Examples

```markdown
### Cameras
- living-room → Main area, wide angle
- front-door → Entrance, motion-triggered

### SSH
- home-server → 192.168.1.100, user: admin

### TTS
- Preferred voice: "Nova"
- Default speaker: Kitchen HomePod
```

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes.
